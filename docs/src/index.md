I am a geophysicist specialising in elastic waves, including forward and inverse problems. My interests includes
<ul>
  <li>Elastic wave equation</li>
  <li>Eikonal equation</li>
  <li>Numerical methods</li>
  <li>Inverse problems</li>
</ul>

I am currently actively developing the following packages.
# JSWAP
A Julia package for anisotropic elastic wave equations. Click (here)[https://github.com/deconvolution/JSWAP] for more.
# RTI
A Julia package for travel time inversion. Click (here)[https://github.com/deconvolution/RTI] for more.
