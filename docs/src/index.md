I am a geophysicist specialising in elastic waves, including forward and inverse problems. My interests includes
<ul>
  <li>Elastic wave equation</li>
  <li>Eikonal equation</li>
  <li>Numerical methods</li>
  <li>Inverse problems</li>
</ul>

I am currently actively developing some packages.

A Julia package for anisotropic elastic wave equations (JSWAP). Click [here](https://github.com/deconvolution/JSWAP) for more.

A Julia package for travel time inversion RTI). Click [here](https://github.com/deconvolution/RTI) for more.
