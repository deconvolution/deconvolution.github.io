I am a geophysicist specialising in elastic waves, including forward and inverse problems. My interests include
- Elastic wave equation
- Eikonal equation
- Numerical methods
- Inverse problems

I am currently actively developing some packages,
- A Julia package for anisotropic elastic wave equations (JSWAP). Click [here](https://github.com/deconvolution/JSWAP) for more.

- A Julia package for travel time inversion RTI). Click [here](https://github.com/deconvolution/RTI) for more.
